Problem:
Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates
Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.

Solution:
def bonAppetit(bill, k, b):
    # Write your code here
    s = sum(bill)
    charges = (s - bill[k]) // 2
    if b == charges:
        print("Bon Appetit")
    else:
        print(b - charges)
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    first_multiple_input = input().rstrip().split()

    n = int(first_multiple_input[0])

    k = int(first_multiple_input[1])

    bill = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))

    b = int(input().strip())

    bonAppetit(bill, k, b)
