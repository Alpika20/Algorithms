Problem:
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/grading/problem?isFullScreen=true
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  gradein the inclusive range from   0to100 .
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade  according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round  gradee up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Solution
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

#
# Complete the 'gradingStudents' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
# The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY grades as parameter.
#

def gradingStudents(grades):
    # Write your code here
    res = []
    for grade in grades:
        if grade >= 38:
            mod5 = grade%5
            if mod5>=3:
                grade = grade + (5-mod5)
        res.append(grade)
    return res

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    grades_count = int(input().strip())

    grades = []

    for _ in range(grades_count):
        grades_item = int(input().strip())
        grades.append(grades_item)

    result = gradingStudents(grades)

    fptr.write('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    fptr.write('\n')

    fptr.close()
