Problem:
A teacher asks the class to open their books to a page number. A student can either start turning pages from the front of the book or from the back of the book. 
They always turn pages one at a time. When they open the book, page  is always on the right side:

Solution:
def pageCount(n, p):
       front = p//2
    if n%2 == 1:
        back = (n - p)//2
    else:
        back = (n-p+1)//2
        
    return min(front,back)
